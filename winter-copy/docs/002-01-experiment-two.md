# (PART) Experiment Two {-}

# Introduction

In experiment 2, **each participant saw 40 trials.**

20 trials were clumped. 20 trials were random.

The order of blocks was randomised for each participant.

Participants had to find 14 out of 15 fruit (not 10 out of 15 as in Experiment 1).

We manipulated two factors: one within-subjects (Resource Distribution) with two levels: 'clumped' and 'random'; and one between-subjects (Fading) with two levels 'fade' and 'no-fade'. The fade condition differeed from experiment 1 in that once a tree had been visited, it was thereafter displayed faded out such that it was apparent to the participant which trees had been visited previously and which had not. The no-fade condition was the same as experiment 1. We expected that the fading would function as a memory aid and reduce revisits as well as making the task easier overall on the other metrics.

As in Experiment 1, We created 20 random stimuli (forests) in which the 15 target fruit items were uniformly distributed about the 30 trees (random condition) and 20 stimuli in which all 15 target fruit items were arranged in one large area (clumped condition) that covered either the left or the right side of the layout.
